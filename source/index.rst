suggestions can be referred to Firescar96 at nchinda.nchinda@libertymutual.com.

The goal of this documentation is to introduce you to blockchain technology and get you started writing smart contracts for Ethereum. Writing smart contracts requires thinking in a way unique from other systems as it also requires understanding of the benefits and limitations of the blockchain technology the smart contracts run on. This guide assumes the reader is a proficient coder in any other programming language, but does is not familiar with blockchain technology.
